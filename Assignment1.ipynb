However in tenderloin this is still close to 1 reported theft a day and it can be discussed whether this is a low number and whether it deserves a \"safe district\" label. Furthermore as mentioned that size of areas are not included in the analysis. In general size and areas are hard to grasp for the human eye. Other parameters not included in the analysis which could be relevant is population density and density of cars, which could also influence the safety of a specific area. Another choice for the plot could be to normalise the data by dividing by total number of incidents accross districts. For some this would be easier to interpret. However is we had a lot of districts some numbers might appear less significant. Also if eg. a single district had a very high number of incidents this would result in this district appearing a the most unsafe and all others appear relativly equally safe-hence making the safety of most districts hard to distinguish between.

    "> 1. **Spike in reported incidents for `PROSTITUTION` on Thursdays**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The high amounts of prostitutions incident reports on Thursdays around 11am and 12pm could be due to some weekly scheduled incident registration for prostitution offences. This might give a wrong indication of how many incidents actually happen on Thursdays and thereby introducing bias in the data. This bias becomes prevalent both when binning the data according to the week day, and when binning according to the hour of the day. It is important to notice this bias when using the data in decisionmaking. Eg. when and where to assign more police to crack down on certain crimes."
